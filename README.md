# Penguin Finder

This is a simple FastAPI application that uses a Random Forest model trained on the Palmer Penguins dataset to predict penguin species from physical measurements.
It includes data cleaning, model training, evaluation and saved model artifacts for later predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- uv

## Setup (uv)

Create the virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
uv venv
uv sync
```

Run the app:

```bash
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Dependency updates (uv)

Add a new dependency:

```bash
uv add <package>
```

Update the lockfile after changes:

```bash
uv lock
```

## Model and data

Model: Random Forest classifier trained on the Palmer Penguins dataset. Random Forest is an ensemble of many decision trees whose combined votes improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. The trained model is stored in `penguin_rf_model.pkl` and loaded at runtime.

Input features:
- bill_length_mm (float)
- bill_depth_mm (float)
- flipper_length_mm (float)

Output:
- predicted species label (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)
- image URL for the predicted species
- info URL linking to the species page

## API endpoints

- `POST /predict`
  Accepts JSON with input features and returns the predicted species, image URL, and info URL.
  Example body:
  ```json
  {
    "bill_length_mm": 43,
    "bill_depth_mm": 12,
    "flipper_length_mm": 250
  }
  ```

- `GET /docs`
  Interactive Swagger UI generated by FastAPI.
